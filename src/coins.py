You have 10 bags full of coins, in each bag are 1.000 coins.

But one bag is full of forgeries, and you can't remember which one.

But you do know that a genuine coins weigh 1 gram, but forgeries weigh 1,1 grams.

To hide the fact that you can't remember which bag contains forgeries, you plan to go just once to the central weighing machine to get ONE ACCURATE weight.

How can you identify the bag with the forgeries with just one weighing?

And what if you didn't know how many bags contain forgeries?
